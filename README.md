# Colorado-Elevation-Map

The code reads elevation data from a file, finds the maximum elevation, and then draws a map using the elevation data. It also allows the user to click on the map to display the elevation at the clicked point. The program continues to run until a key is pressed.

Must have dudraw pip installed.
